PATTCALL


This is going to be a collection of some numerical routines related to pattern classification and some popular implementations techniques.

The code will be added from time to time.

And, a new code module may be added even if it is not complete or working.

There will be an attempt to get working items together.

So, I guess, I will have two directories. One for broken code. One for working code.

More on that later.
